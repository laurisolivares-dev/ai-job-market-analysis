ðŸ“Š AI Job Market & Salary Analysis 2025

This project explores the Artificial Intelligence job market in 2025, focusing on salary trends, skills demand, experience levels, and geographic hiring patterns. It is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project â€” combining data cleaning, transformation, and visual storytelling to derive actionable insights from real-world job postings.

It is my second data project. While the first introduced me to foundational EDA, this one deepens my skills in structuring an end-to-end analysis using Pandas, visual tools, and public datasets. My goal is to keep growing toward a future role as a Data Engineer.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Practice core components of the ETL process (mainly Extract and Transform) using Python and Pandas

Clean, standardize, and enrich data for reliable interpretation

Analyze job market trends such as salary range, skill demand, and experience levels

Build visualizations to communicate findings effectively

Use a cloud-based, open-source workflow with Google Colab and GitHub

ðŸ“¦ Project Scope

Dataset: AI job postings from Kaggle (2025)

Time coverage: Up to April 2025 â€” providing a fresh and current view of the job market

Geographic coverage: Global â€” with listings from numerous countries

This scope helps us answer questions such as:

What are the most requested AI skills?

What roles are companies hiring for by experience level?

How do salaries vary by country or seniority?

ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies

Python: Core programming language

Pandas: For cleaning, transforming, and analyzing data

Matplotlib & Seaborn: To visualize job market patterns

Google Colab: Online Jupyter-based development environment

GitHub: Version control and project sharing

HTML (DataFrames): For styled output visualization in tables

ðŸ”Ž Key Analyses Conducted

Standardization of experience level, employment type, and company size data

Top 10 most in-demand AI skills (based on required_skills field)

Distribution of AI job offers by country and experience level

Salary range analysis categorized by percentiles (Low, Moderate, High)

Cross-comparison of salary ranges by country and by experience

ðŸŒ± Why This Matters

In todayâ€™s data-driven world, the ability to analyze messy, real-world datasets â€” cleaning, transforming, and drawing meaningful conclusions â€” is essential for any aspiring Data Engineer.

This project demonstrates not only technical proficiency, but also data storytelling â€” a key skill for communicating findings in business or research environments.

As a professional in transition, especially coming from Venezuela and rebuilding my career path in a new country, this project represents my commitment to adapting and thriving in the global data ecosystem.
