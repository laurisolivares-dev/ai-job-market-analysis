# 📊 AI Job Market & Salary Analysis 2025

This project explores the 2025 job market for Artificial Intelligence professionals, focusing on salary trends, in-demand skills, remote work opportunities, and hiring patterns by country and experience level.

It is my second data project. Unlike the first—which was mostly exploratory—this one is more technical, implementing a full ETL pipeline, web scraping, data transformations, and visual storytelling through graphs.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Practice the full ETL process (Extract, Transform, Load) using Python and Pandas.
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure accurate analysis.
- Apply web scraping using BeautifulSoup to enrich the dataset.
- Create visualizations to communicate insights clearly.
- Use a cloud-oriented approach (Google Colab + GitHub).

## 🔍 Project Scope

- **Time coverage**: Job postings from previous years up to **April 2025**.
- **Geographic coverage**: Listings from various countries, enabling international salary and skill comparisons.
- **Fields analyzed**: employment type, experience level, company size, required skills, salary, etc.
