# AI Job Market & Salary Analysis 2025

This project explores the Artificial Intelligence job market in 2025, focusing on **salary trends**, **skills demand**, **remote work distribution**, and **industry hiring patterns**.

It is my **second data project**, and unlike my first one — which was more focused on exploratory data analysis — this one is **more technical**, incorporating a complete **ETL process**, **web scraping**, and **advanced data transformations**.  
The goal is to keep strengthening my skills as a **Data Engineer**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Practice the full **ETL process** (Extract, Transform, Load) using Python and Pandas.
- Perform **data cleaning and preprocessing** for accurate analysis.
- Apply **web scraping** with BeautifulSoup to enrich the dataset.
- Create **visualizations** to communicate insights effectively.
- Use a **cloud-oriented approach** with Google Colab and GitHub.

## 📌 Project Scope

This project is based on a dataset that contains AI job listings from multiple countries, with detailed information on roles, skills, salaries, company size, and more.

**🗓️ Time coverage:**  
The dataset includes job postings from previous years up to **April 2025**, making this analysis highly relevant and aligned with current AI job market trends.

**🌎 Geographic coverage:**  
Jobs are listed across multiple countries, allowing for international comparison of salaries, remote work adoption, and skill demand.

This scope allows us to identify what employers are currently seeking in AI professionals and how trends vary over time, region, and role.

## 💡 Why This Matters

In today’s data-driven world, the ability to work with datasets like this — **cleaning, transforming, analyzing, and visualizing** — is essential for **Data Engineers** and **Data Analysts**.  
This project showcases not just technical skills, but also the power of combining multiple tools to extract meaningful insights from raw data.
