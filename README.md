## ðŸ“Š AI Job Market & Salary Analysis 2025

This project is an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the Artificial Intelligence job market in 2025. It focuses on salary trends, in-demand skills, experience levels, and geographic hiring patterns. The entire workflow â€” from data cleaning to insightful visualizations â€” was performed using Python and open-source tools.

It marks my **second data project** and represents a deeper dive into structuring end-to-end EDA using real-world datasets. My objective is to strengthen my analytical and visualization skills as I transition into the field of Data Engineering.
